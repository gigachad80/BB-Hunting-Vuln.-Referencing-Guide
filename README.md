## ⚡ Quick Info

- **⏱️ Creation Time:** ~10 minutes of research & compilation + 15 min of writing * editing README
- **🤖 Generated with:** Claude Sonnet 4 (4-5 prompts) and edited by me. Fun fact : (After generation, Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 - the same moment when it got completed . I still remember the popup)
- **📚 Sources:** Recent bug bounty writeups (2024-2025), HackerOne/Bugcrowd reports, OWASP guidelines, PortSwigger research, security blogs, and penetration testing methodologies
- **🎯 Coverage:** 20+ vulnerability types, 100+ variants, real-world exploitation techniques

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Points for Successful Bug Hunting:**
> 1. **Know your target's tech stack** - Different technologies = different vulnerabilities
> 2. **Focus on high-impact vulns first** - RCE, SQLi, Auth bypass = bigger bounties
> 3. **Chain vulnerabilities** - Combine XSS + CSRF, SSRF + Cloud metadata, etc.
> 4. **Stay updated** - New attack vectors emerge constantly (LLM injection, API security)
> 5. **Read recent writeups** - Learn from others' successful submissions
> 6. **Automate reconnaissance** - Manual testing for exploitation
> 7. **Master one vulnerability deeply** - Then expand to others

## 🔥 What Makes This Guide Different

🎯 **Experience-Driven**: Based on hunting 1000+ real bugs, not just theory  
🔍 **Stack-Specific**: Tells you EXACTLY where each vuln appears (e.g., "LFI in old PHP sites", "IDOR in React APIs")  
⚡ **Modern Focus**: Includes 2024-2025 trends (LLM injection, GraphQL security, cloud-native vulns)  
🛠️ **Actionable**: Ready-to-use payloads and bypass techniques  
📊 **Organized**: Easy-to-scan tables for quick reference during testing  
🔗 **Comprehensive**: Covers everything from classic SQLi to bleeding-edge AI vulnerabilities

## 💰 Bounty Severity Reference

| **Severity** | **Vulnerabilities** | **Typical Bounty** |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | RCE, SQL Injection (data access), Full account takeover, Auth bypass | $5,000 - $50,000+ |
| **High** | SSRF (internal access), Stored XSS, IDOR (sensitive data), XXE, Deserialization | $1,000 - $10,000 |
| **Medium** | Reflected XSS, CSRF (important functions), Open redirect (chained), LFI, Subdomain takeover | $250 - $2,000 |

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

### 1️⃣ **During Reconnaissance:**
- Identify target's technology stack (Wappalyzer, BuiltWith)
- Reference the guide to know which vulnerabilities are most likely
- Focus your testing on high-probability areas

### 2️⃣ **During Testing:**
- Use the vulnerability tables as a checklist
- Apply stack-specific payloads and techniques
- Try bypass methods if initial attempts are blocked

### 3️⃣ **For Learning:**
- Study one vulnerability type at a time in depth
- Practice payloads in safe environments (CTFs, labs)
- Read the "Modern Trends" section for emerging threats

### 4️⃣ **For Quick Reference:**
- Use Table of Contents to jump to specific vulnerabilities
- Scan the "Key Hunting Areas" columns for quick insights
- Check "Platform-Specific Patterns" for targeted hunting
